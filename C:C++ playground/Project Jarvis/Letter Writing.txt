Dear householder

Imagine a world where there is no sickness... death is only a memory, and the feeling of loss only
exists when you can't find your keys. Imagine a time when you are so happy that you forget
how much pain you were ever in. Imagine a world where the ruler doesn't die and they full-fill all
the promises they make... Like a dream, but it isn't.

If you have a bible please go get it if you don't you can get one for free from this link...
https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/ . You can even get one in a language you are more comfortable 
with, just change the language at the top right where is says english. Anyway, when you do get a bible
please open for me 2 bible verses, Revelations 21:4 & Daniel 2:44.

It is quite clear, reading these verses brings a potent hope into our hearts. We long for this 
kind of reality and it apparent to all of us. I am sure it is apparent to you too, householder.
The bible promises us that this will soon come too be our reality. This will soon be how we live
and it will be the happiest any human to ever exist has ever been. The second verse attests to 
the endlessness of God and his Kingdom. Do you, dear householder, want to be part of it ??

Earning a place in this Kingdom isn't an easy task but the rewards outweigh the difficulty. 
In order to learn more about how to earn a place in this Kingdom you could call me so we can discuss
how to start your journey of learning or you could go to jw.org and request a bible study
that will be conducted at your convenience and at your pace. This study will teach you all about this 
hope and so much more. :)
