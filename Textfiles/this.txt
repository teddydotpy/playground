Dear householder

We have hope, me and you. We have faith you and I. I believe we really aren't that different. Let me explain.
We are both living under a great panademic ( The temptation to call this a panoramic was great. ) and we have faith and the hope
that it will end up a thing of the past. We have hope that there exists someone, a group of people and or an organization that 
will use all their power to try and get us out of this situation. That my dear householder is hope and faith in the most purest form.
So to believe in things, to hope is human nature and our most powerful ally.

We live in a terrible world. We live in the most deplorable time and everyone can feel it. But there exists a hope that i would
love to share. A hope that will reveal how our story as the inhabitants of earth ends. Is that something you would love to find out about ??
If you woud, please read 2 bible verse with me... if you do not have a bible you could get a free pdf bible from
https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/ . You can even choose a language from over the 1000 languages available on the site. Once you 
have found a bible please first open Titus 1 and read from one to 2. This shows that the hope that God gave to us... to humans, is everlasting 
life... Immortality in a world filled with happiness and peace. Please then open John 17:3. A simple verse but quite powerful
it gives us the know how... the prerequisite knowlegde neccessary to achieve this future. All we have to do is learn about God... learn
who he is and what he wants... and he will fix all the problems that we have ever had and could ever have.

What a wonderful hope indeed. Therefore I implore you, dear householder to seek the truth and if you have any questions, whatsoever, I could
answer them or you could request a personal bible study from https://www.jw.org/ that willl give you a more in depth understanding of the
bible and of the hope. 

yours
