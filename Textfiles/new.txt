Dear HouseHolder

Did you know the world was specially built for you ?? For us as the human race ?? Did you know that you are very special and loved ??
Many people don't feel that way. But that's a story for another day. If you will, i'd love to steal a moment from you.
There is a enormous amount of evidence that makes this quite obvious to those looking... From the placement of the earth to the way our bodies
experience existence. It is a grand life we live. 

Because of these things all I have come to share with you is this. Love abundantly.
If you have a moment please read with me 2 bible verse ... if you do not have a bible you could get a free pdf bible from
https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/ . You can even choose a language from over the 1000 languages available on the site.
1 John 4:9 and 11 is the verse.

There is not much to say beyond that. Love is abundantly shown to us and so I implore you to love as hard and as vastly as you can.
If you want to know more about the man that loved in the best way you can reach me at... and you could also 
request a personal bible study that will teach you all about this person and how you could get closer tho him
and show.

sincerely yours 
Anon
